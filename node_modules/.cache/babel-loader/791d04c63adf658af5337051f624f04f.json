Then, we activate the option \"Show test networks\" and we will see how the different test networks appear, where we have to click on the Kovan test network. </NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag1}></Img>\n                <NewP>We can see that in this test network we also do not have enough ether to pay for the gas for the transactions. To obtain gas for the test networks we can visit the following link: <b><NewLinkWithoutline href=\"https://faucets.chain.link/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chainlink faucet</NewLinkWithoutline></b></NewP>\n                <NewP>At the top right you will see a button that says <b>Connect wallet</b>. We must click it and connect our wallet to this site.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag2}></Img>\n                <NewP>We will then see that our wallet address has been connected to the website and, after completing the captcha, we will be able to request ether. By default, every time we make a request it will give us 0.1 ether and 10 LINK. This last token will not be necessary to operate within the DApp.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag3}></Img>\n                <NewH1>DApp operation</NewH1>\n                <NewP>Now that we have all the previous preparations, we can start interacting with the DApp. In the main page there are some interesting links to learn more about this project, how it works, what is the 3-SAT problem or how Chainlink oracles work. If it is our first time, we must register by clicking on the <b>Get started</b> button. This will take you to the registration page where you will be asked for some information: your name, email and researcher ORCID.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag4}></Img>\n                <NewP>Whenever we perform a function that involves writing data to the blockchain, Metamask will ask us if we want to confirm the transaction or if we want to reject it. </NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag5}></Img>\n                <NewP>In addition, it will show us a summary of the transaction, the expected waiting time and an approximation of the cost in gas that the transaction will have. All these data (and many others such as block number, gas fee, gas price, gas limit...) can also be verified in <b><NewLinkWithoutline href=\"https://kovan.etherscan.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kovan scan</NewLinkWithoutline></b>, accessing through the address of our wallet, which appears in Metamask. We could even see all the interactions performed by the smart contract by doing a search with the smart contract address.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag6}></Img>\n                <NewP>Once we have registered in the application, we will automatically receive an email with a password. This password is associated to our ORCID in the sense that an ORCID will always output the same password. In the Sign in page we will enter this password to access the user panel.</NewP>\n                <NewP>In this page we can find the main functionality of the application. The first form allows to generate instances using two generators: A and B generator. The A generator generates proposition symbols and, at the same time, the instance clauses. This is why the first proposition symbols are more likely to appear in the clauses (especially at the beginning) as the instance is created. On the other hand, generator B first builds a skeleton of the instance, then generates all proposition symbols and finally fills in the instances. Note how, in this case, all symbols have the same probability of appearing in each of the clauses.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag7}></Img>\n                <NewP>These two generators make use of random numbers, which are obtained thanks to the Chainlink oracles. Before generating an instance, the user must generate a random number. To do so, the user must click on the grey hexagon in the top-left corner of the form. This will launch a transaction to the oracles and request randomness. The process of obtaining this random number takes approximately 50 seconds because it is a two-transaction process. Once we have generated the numbers, a pop-up window will appear informing us.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag8}></Img>\n                <NewP>We have our random number. The next step is to generate one or more instances. To do this, the form has two parameters called \"p\" and \"q\". Basically, the \"p\" parameter indicates the probability of generating a new proposition symbol: the higher the probability, the more different proposition symbols our instances will have (setting a value around p = 10 is a good start). On the other hand, the parameter \"q\" indicates the probability of generating a new clause: the higher the probability, the more clauses our instance will have. Finally, the last parameter indicates the number of instances we want to generate at the same time (between 1 and 5).</NewP>\n                <NewP>The second of the forms shown in the image allows us to search for instances generated by a given ORCID, whether it is ours or not. The action will display a table containing a summary of the instances generated by an ORCID: instance id, size in clauses, creation date and whether they have been resolved or not.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag9}></Img>\n                <NewP>When we click on one of the rows, this will take us to the page where the instance is displayed. Here, we can also download the instance in JSON format by clicking on the button in the second row of the table. In addition, if the instance is ours and is not solved, a form will appear where we can insert the hash of the file containing the solution to the instance, the hash of the algorithm that has been used and the method to calculate the hash values.</NewP>\n                <Img alt=\"dev\" src={imag10}></Img>\n                <NewP>Finally, it should be noted that each time a new set of instances is generated, we should ask the oracles for randomness again. If we do not do so, the instances we generate will potentially be very similar to each other.</NewP>\n                <NewP>By making use of this tool, the application allows us to generate completely random dynamic instances without the need for a third party, storing who created the instance, at what time, what the instance looked like, when it was solved, solution hashes and the algorithm used to check the veracity of the instances.</NewP>\n                <NewP>In the Home page of the application, at the bottom of the Footer section, you can find more information about the research group and a contact in case of any doubt or suggestion about this instance generator.</NewP>\n            </Wrap>\n        </Container>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default HowItWorks;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
